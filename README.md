# Command Line in Linux
</br>

### <ins>Objective</ins>

The "Command Line in Linux" project is designed to equip learners with essential Linux command-line skills through a hands-on, structured approach. Participants will learn to interact with Linux systems, manipulate files and directories, and search for data effectively, all while gaining a deeper understanding of the Linux environment. These skills are fundamental for tasks like system administration, cybersecurity operations, and development workflows, particularly in environments that rely heavily on CLI tools. The course emphasizes practical learning through real-world scenarios.

### <ins>Skills Gained</ins>

1. **System Interaction:**
    - Opening a terminal and displaying environment variables like SHELL and HOME.
    - Using commands like pwd to locate the current directory.
2. **File & Directory Management:**
   - Listing files and directories with ls, including hidden files.
   - Navigating directories using cd with absolute paths, relative paths, or no arguments.
   - Creating, copying, and deleting files and directories using commands like touch, cp, mkdir, rm, rmdir, and rm -rf.
3. **Permission Management:**
     - Adjusting directory permissions using chmod to control access (e.g., user, group, others).
4. **Search & Analysis:**
   - Searching for patterns in files using grep, including recursive operations.
   - Locating files using find, with error message redirection for seamless operation.

### <ins>Walkthrough</ins>

This project will consist of 5 tasks, which are as follows:
1. Create a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Apply authentication on the switches
3. Apply authentication on the router
4. Enable PCs from different VLANs to communicate with each other
5. Configure DHCP on the router and secure the ports of the switch from unauthorized access
