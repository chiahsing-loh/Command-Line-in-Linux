# Command Line in Linux
</br>

### <ins>Objective</ins>

The "Command Line in Linux" project is designed to equip learners with essential Linux command-line skills through a hands-on, structured approach. Participants will learn to interact with Linux systems, manipulate files and directories, and search for data effectively, all while gaining a deeper understanding of the Linux environment. These skills are fundamental for tasks like system administration, cybersecurity operations, and development workflows, particularly in environments that rely heavily on CLI tools. The course emphasizes practical learning through real-world scenarios.

</br></br>
### <ins>Skills Gained</ins>

1. **System Interaction:**
    - Opening a terminal and displaying environment variables like `SHELL` and `HOME`.
    - Using commands like `pwd` to locate the current directory.
2. **File & Directory Management:**
   - Listing files and directories with `ls`, including hidden files.
   - Navigating directories using `cd` with absolute paths, relative paths, or no arguments.
   - Creating, copying, and deleting files and directories using commands like `touch`, `cp`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `rmdir`, and `rm -rf`.
3. **Permission Management:**
     - Adjusting directory permissions using `chmod` to control access (e.g., user, group, others).
4. **Search & Analysis:**
   - Searching for patterns in files using `grep`, including recursive operations.
   - Locating files using `find`, with error message redirection for seamless operation.

</br></br>
### <ins>Tools</ins>

1. **Linux Terminal:** The command-line interface for executing tasks.
2. **Environment Variables:** `SHELL` and `HOME` variables for system interaction.
3. **CLI Utilities:** Commands like `pwd`, `ls -l`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `touch`, `cp`, `find`, and `grep`.
4. **Linux File System:** A hierarchical structure utilized for file and directory organization.
5. **Permission Control Mechanisms:** Tools like `chmod` to modify access settings.

### <ins>Walkthrough</ins>

The project consists of five structured tasks, each focusing on essential Linux commands:
1. Display the home directory from a terminal.
2. List files and directories using `ls`.
3. Use the `cd` command to change directories.
4. Use `touch`, `cp`, `mkdir`, and `rm` to create and remove files and directories.
5. Search for files using `find`, search for patterns using `grep`.

Note: The working directory for this course will be `/home/coder`.

#### <ins>Task 1: Display the home directory from a terminal</ins>

In Linux, a **shell** is a command-line interpreter that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system's kernel. It allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands, running programs, and managing system processes. Essentially the **shell** is a programming environment on the command line that takes your typed text-based commands and translates them into instructions for the kernel to execute. It is always useful to know what **shell** environment you are using on as some commands are specific to a particular **shell**, and may behave differently in other **shell**.

The `echo` command is used to print whatever follows it to the screen. `$` means content of the **shell**. The command `echo $SHELL` will print out the **SHELL** environment variable. In this case, we are using `/bin/bash` as shown in Figure 1.

</br></br>
In Figure 1, the `pwd` command will display the current directory we are in. Directories are similar to folders in Windows File Explorer. In this case, the home directory is `/home/coder`.

Next, we will use `echo` command to print out the contents of the **HOME** environment variable. The `echo $HOME` command gives us `/home/coder` which is the user's home directory for storing files.

Both `$SHELL` and `$HOME` are known as environment variables.

In Figure 2, the `env` command will generate a whole list of environment variables. Within this list, we can locate our **SHELL** environment - `SHELL=/bin/bash` as well as **HOME** environment - `HOME=/home/coder`.

To clear out  the screen, simply type the `clear` command in the CLI.

In figure 3, the command `ls`, when used with no options or arguments, will list out all the files and/or directories in the user's directory.

In contrast, the command `ls -l` will display more details about a file or directory. Details such as the file type, permissions, ownerships and timestamp will be listed.
