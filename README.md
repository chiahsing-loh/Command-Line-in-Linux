# Command Line in Linux
</br>

### <ins>Objective</ins>

The "Command Line in Linux" project is designed to equip learners with essential Linux command-line skills through a hands-on, structured approach. Participants will learn to interact with Linux systems, manipulate files and directories, and search for data effectively, all while gaining a deeper understanding of the Linux environment. These skills are fundamental for tasks like system administration, cybersecurity operations, and development workflows, particularly in environments that rely heavily on CLI tools. The course emphasizes practical learning through real-world scenarios.

### <ins>Skills Gained</ins>

- Configuring authentication on network devices (routers and switches)
- Implementing DHCP for efficient IP management.
- Securing switch ports to mitigate security threats.
- Utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and troubleshooting.
- Advanced understanding of network security concepts, best practices, and practical applications.
</br></br>
### <ins>Tools</ins>

- Cisco Packet Tracer (Network simulation software).
- Router and Switch configurations (CLI-based security settings)
- Networking protocols (Authentication, DHCP, and security best practices). 
</br></br>

### <ins>Walkthrough</ins>

This project will consist of 5 tasks, which are as follows:
1. Create a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Apply authentication on the switches
3. Apply authentication on the router
4. Enable PCs from different VLANs to communicate with each other
5. Configure DHCP on the router and secure the ports of the switch from unauthorized access
